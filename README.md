# My Portfolio App

I wanted to create my own website to showcase past projects and my current skills to prospective employers. I created a short bio and resume on the home page. I also created a project page (contains links to past projects) and a contact page. This project has been a great creative outlit for me and I've had so much fun playing around with styling!

This project was created mainly with JavaScript, MUI, CSS, and HTML and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

Fork this project and open it in your code editer of choice (I used VS Code).

In your console, you can run: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
